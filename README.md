# Data-Wrangling-Project

The data wrangling project was a project that enhanced my data gathering, cleaning and analysis skills. The data extracted from Twitter API was merged with cleaned data from image prediction and twitter archive file. The benefits of data wrangling in our analysis includes;
• The data's integrity is guaranteed.
• provide quick data insights and decision support.
• Data that is noisy, faulty, or missing is cleaned.
• It makes sense for the resulting dataset since it collects information that serves as a predata mining step.
• By transforming raw data into the necessary format and cleaning it, it helps to make tangible and make decisions.
